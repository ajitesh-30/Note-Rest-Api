# Challenges

This repo contains programming challenges that you must solve to
get to a face-to-face round with the TableGrabber Engineering team after
the initial call.

## Submission Details

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the respective challenges, you have
to follow these steps after you're done with coding your challenge:

- Publish it in a public GitHub repo
- Deploy it somewhere. For purely client-side projects, you can
deploy them on GitHub pages. For projects involving server-side code, you
can use Heroku.
- Send an email to the person from TableGrabber who assigned you the task,
with the link to the repo and the URL where it is live.

## General Guidelines

The challenges are designed such that they should not take more than a week to
solve. Hence, you will be expected to revert with the solution within 7-10
days.

Try to follow coding conventions of the language you are solving your challenge
in. Also, try to document the code (inline comments, module level docs, readme)
as much as possible.
