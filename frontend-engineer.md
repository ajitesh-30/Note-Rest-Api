# Frontend Engineer Challenge

## Problem statement

Build a Restaurant Finder Web application

## Instructions
- Goto https://developers.zomato.com/api and signup for a Free API key.
- Goto https://developers.zomato.com/documentation to see the list of available API’s.
- Use the API’s to build a simple Restaurant Finder.

## Requirements

- User must select the City he’s looking to search the restaurant.
- The listing page must display the nearby restaurants along with a restaurant featured image, rating, votes & reviews count. Display paginated results.
- On clicking the restaurant, it should navigate to the details page. Show all the relevant information, and make the page as unique as possible.
- The details page must have a reviews section which should display only 5 reviews with a more button. On clicking more button, navigate to a reviews page showing all reviews. Implement pagination on this page.
- Implement a Like feature for the restaurants. User must be able to like or unlike the
restaurant. If the user has liked the restaurant, it should be displayed in both listing & detail page. The likes are not to be posted to the server, but maintained only on the client side.

## Tech stack

You may only use vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks should be used.
You may not use any CSS frameworks, like Bootstrap, either.


## Good to have

- Infinite scroll pagination for the listing page & reviews page.
- Use Geolocation to automatically set the user location & get the nearby restaurants.
